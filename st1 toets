Q1. Suppose you have two vectors,
𝑥 =
(
−0.94
−0.97
0.74
−0.27
1.25
0.42
0.66
−0.68
−0.63)
and 𝑦 =
(
0.40
0.02
2.63
−0.01
0.72
1.93
−0.94
−0.31
−0.30)
Create two matrices A and B with the vectors 𝑥 and 𝑦, respectively, with 3 rows and 3
columns. Then,
i. Find the summation of A and B.
ii. Find the product of A and B with matrix multiplication.
iii. Find the inverse of A (first check if the matrix is nonsingular).
iv. Find the determinant of the product that you have obtained in (iii).
v. Compute the eigenvalues and eigen vectors of the product matrix you obtained
in (iii) and obtain the summation and product of the eigen values.

Q2.
a. Create a data frame with at least 5 columns and 10 rows, containing both numerical
and categorical variables.
b. Display the first 6 rows of the data frame.
c. Add a new column to the data frame that is the sum of the values in the second and
third columns.
d. Compute summary statistics for each column of the data frame.


Q3. It was found in a country that the average male height is 180.3 cm, while the average
female height is 167.2 cm. We assume that the height distributions for male and female
are normal with mean = 180.3 cm and variance = 10 cm, and with mean = 167.2 cm and
variance = 15 cm, respectively.
If you meet a man and a woman, independently, then what is more likely (between the
following two situations)?
- that the man will be bigger than 200 or lesser than 165 cm?
- that the woman will be between 166 and 168 cm?


Q4. Obtain a sequence of nonzero numbers of length 1000 between 0 and 1 (excluding
the endpoints). Then draw a graph of function 𝑝. 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑝) for 0 < 𝑝 ≤ 1. (Hint: First save
the values of 𝑝 and 𝑝. 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑝) as a data frame.)


Q5. Consider the ‘airquality’ dataset. This dataset contains daily readings of the air quality
measures from May 1, 1973 to September 30, 1973 in New York. Perform a statistical
analysis of the data and write a 3-page report. Your report should contain a brief
description of the dataset, basic statistical analysis and exploratory analysis with the help
of statistical plots.
